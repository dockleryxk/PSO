# PSO
## Overview
From Wikipedia:
```
In computer science, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method 
that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution 
with regard to a given measure of quality. PSO optimizes a problem by having a 
population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these 
particles around in the search-space according to simple mathematical formulae 
over the particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is influenced 
by its local best known position but, is also guided toward the best known 
positions in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found 
by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions.
